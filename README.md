Ever wanted to go through a ton of images on e621 and download each one? Well, this thing does that.
WARNING: Intense WIP

This web page needs to be hosted on a server with php installed in order for it to work, so first you'll have to either set up a localhost or host it somewhere on the internet.

How to use:
1. Open index.html
2. Input your login and api_key (See how to get that below) in the appropriate text boxes (Used only for upvoting the images you download)
3. Put required tags as you would on e621, except instead of spacebar use +
4. Press "Start loading images"
5. Use the left-over buttons to navigate

How to get your API key:
1. Log in on e621
2. Press "Account" on the top bar
3. Press "Manage API access"
4. Re enter your password
5. Your key should be there
